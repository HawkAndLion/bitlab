Task at IT school
Aim: Create a GUI window for Clients, so they can send messages to server.
At first, Client has to specify IP & PORT. If it is correct, Client should be transfered to another page/GUI window/, where he/she can leave a message.
There is no need to create a separate server. Terminal of IntelliJ IDEA will be performing server. But it has to accept and deal with several Clients at the same time.
